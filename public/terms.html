        <h2>6. Payment and Billing</h2>
        <p>
          Certain features of the Service require payment. By subscribing to a paid plan, you agree
          to pay all applicable fees as described at the time of purchase.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Billing Cycle:</strong> Paid subscriptions are billed in advance on a monthly or
          annual basis, depending on the plan you select. Your subscription will automatically renew
          at the end of each billing period unless you cancel before the renewal date.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Payment Method:</strong> You must provide a valid payment method to subscribe to a
          paid plan. You authorize us to charge your payment method for all fees incurred. If your
          payment method fails, we may suspend your access to paid features until payment is
          received.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Price Changes:</strong> We may change our prices at any time. Price changes for
          existing subscribers will take effect at the start of the next billing period following
          notice of the change. Your continued use of the Service after a price change constitutes
          acceptance of the new price.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Refunds:</strong> All fees are non-refundable except as required by law or as
          explicitly stated in these Terms. If you cancel your subscription, you will continue to
          have access to paid features until the end of your current billing period, but you will
          not receive a refund for any unused portion.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Taxes:</strong> All fees are exclusive of applicable taxes, levies, or duties. You
          are responsible for paying all such taxes associated with your use of the Service.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Data Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Your use of the Service is subject to our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, which
          describes how we collect, use, and protect your personal information.
        </p>
        <p>We collect and process the following types of data:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Account information such as your name, email address, and payment details</li>
          <li>Your Content, including audio recordings, transcripts, and metadata</li>
          <li>Usage data, including how you interact with the Service</li>
          <li>Technical data such as IP addresses, browser type, and device information</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We use industry-standard security measures to protect your data, including encryption in
          transit and at rest. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we
          cannot guarantee absolute security.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may share your data with third-party service providers who assist us in operating the
          Service, such as cloud hosting providers, payment processors, and analytics services. We
          require these providers to maintain the confidentiality of your data.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you direct us to distribute Your Content to third-party platforms (such as Spotify,
          Apple Podcasts, or YouTube), your data will be subject to those platforms' respective
          privacy policies and terms of service.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Service Availability</h2>
        <p>
          We strive to maintain high availability of the Service, but do not guarantee uninterrupted
          access. The Service may be temporarily unavailable due to maintenance, updates, or
          circumstances beyond our control.
        </p>
        <p>
          We aim for 99.9% uptime but provide no service level agreement or guarantee unless
          separately agreed in writing. Scheduled maintenance will typically be performed during
          off-peak hours, and we will endeavor to provide advance notice of significant planned
          downtime.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Service depends on third-party services including cloud hosting providers, AI
          processing services, and distribution platforms. We are not responsible for outages or
          performance issues caused by these third-party services.
        </p>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Service (or any part thereof)
          at any time, with or without notice. We will not be liable to you or any third party for
          any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Service.
        </p>

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO SOME OF
          THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN SUCH CASES, OUR LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED
          TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>
          You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Podcastomatic and its affiliates,
          officers, directors, employees, agents, and licensors from and against any and all claims,

          <li>Any claim that Your Content caused damage to a third party</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>12. Termination</h2>
        <p>
          You may terminate your account at any time by contacting us or using the account deletion
          feature in your settings. Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately
          cease.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time, with or without cause,
          and with or without notice. Reasons for termination may include, but are not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>

          <li>Requests by law enforcement or government agencies</li>

          <li>Unexpected technical issues</li>
          <li>Extended periods of inactivity</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Upon termination:</p>

          <li>You must cease all use of the Service</li>
          <li>We may delete Your Content and account data</li>

          you may request an export of your data. After this period, Your Content may be permanently
          deleted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sections of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination will survive,
          including ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnification, and limitations of
          liability.
        </p>

        <h2>13. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>
          We may modify these Terms at any time. We will notify you of material changes by posting
          the updated Terms on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.
        </p>
        <p>
          For material changes that adversely affect your rights, we will provide at least 30 days'
          notice before the changes take effect, via email to the address associated with your
          account or through a prominent notice within the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your continued use of the Service after the effective date of any changes constitutes your
          acceptance of the modified Terms. If you do not agree to the modified Terms, you must stop

        <h2>14. Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Informal Resolution:</strong> Before filing any formal legal claim, you agree to
          contact us and attempt to resolve the dispute informally. Most disputes can be resolved
          this way.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Arbitration:</strong> If we cannot resolve the dispute informally, you and
          Podcastomatic agree to resolve any claims through final and binding arbitration, except as
          set forth below. The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the
          arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be conducted in
          English, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Class Action Waiver:</strong> You and Podcastomatic agree that any dispute
          resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class,
          consolidated, or representative action.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Exceptions:</strong> Either party may bring a lawsuit in court for claims related
          to intellectual property infringement or to seek injunctive or other equitable relief.
        </p>

        <h2>15. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
          Delaware, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          For any disputes not subject to arbitration, you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and
          venue of the state and federal courts located in Delaware.
